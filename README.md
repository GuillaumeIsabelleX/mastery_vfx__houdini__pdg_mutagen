*Toolset for generating and handling large Wedge variation counts in Houdini with PDG/TOPs*

<br>

## About
**PDG Mutagen** is a toolset designed to efficently and intuitively handle the often large Wedge variation counts and data amounts when working with PDG Wedging in *Â©SideFX Houdini*.


It includes a Python Panel Interface the **Mutagen Viewer**, that allows you to display and play back the PDG wedge variations:
* Allows to visually select a specific wedge variation that will then be selected in the PDG Graph as well
* Right click in wedge variation to open full-size rendered image sequence in RV or File Browser
* Mark/label wedge variations you like, save the selection
* "Setup Mutation" Tool to generate new base wedge node containing all wedge parameters from marked wedge variations



It also includes a **PDG Mutagen Shelf** containing additional utility tools:
* *Mutagen Setup* creates a PDG Graph Template with basic wedging setup, designed to work with the *Mutagen Viewer* and other *Mutagen Tools*.
* *Convert Takes to Wedges* converts variations you have set up in the "classical take style" to a single wedge TOP that holds all the edited parameters. Append additional wedge TOPs as you like to generate further variation
* *Select Wedge Index* lets you numerically enter a target wedge index like "0_1_4_6_2" and selects it in the PDG graph. This is handy for large wedge counts where visual selection is tedious or impossible
* *Split IM Montage* splits ImageMagick monatge in two separate streams. This is handy for very large wedging setups which become unhandy in a single montage and also ImageMagick concatenation will fail



<br>
**PDG Mutagen** is in prototype stage and for experimental use.
It may contain bugs and the code is not fully cleaned up. Feel free to customize to your needs.

Compatible with *Houdini 17.5.x | Tested with 17.5.299*
